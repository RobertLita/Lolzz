# Lolzz
#### This project was done during Advanced Frontend Course (3rd year, first semester), where I chose to build a web app using React. I've done a <i>minimal</i> <b>League of Legends</b> history tracker, where you can:
 - Sign up & Login
 - Search for a League of Legends profile and region
 - Get details about the last matches you played & your ranks  

## Tools used ðŸ§°
 - Firebase for register, login and deploy
 - Riot Games LOL api
 - React Redux
 - Mantine - a UI React library
 
 ## What I've learned ðŸ“™
  - How React works
  - useState, useEffect, useCallback
  - Routing
  - Passing data through props
  - Fetching data from api
  - Firebase
  - React Redux
